## General Info

These JavaScript mini apps are all different projects built during my studying at Integrify Coding Academy in Helsinki. They are either part of the Integrify curricula or projects coded within the 30 Days JavaScript Challenge created by my teacher Asabeneh Yetayeh. Thanks to these projects, coded entirely from scratch, with no help from videos or coding along with tutorials, I have strengthened considerably my problem-solving skills, and I have improved my ability to be an active learner and to think and structure the code from scratch. The app section is built entirely on JavaScript.
