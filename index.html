They are either part of the Integrify curricula or projects coded within the 30 Days JavaScript Challenge created by my teacher Asabeneh Yetayeh. Thanks to these projects, coded entirely from scratch,with no help from videos or coding along tutorials, I have strengthened considerably my problem solving skills, and I have improved my ability to be an active learner and to think and structure the code from scratch. <br><br>The projects use all features from ES6, functional programming, destructuring, all time of loops (yes, there is not only for and for Each) fetch, Sets, form validations, regular expessions,among others. I am now able to code pages entirely with JavaScript without touching HTML or CSS. The beauty of JavaScript is also this. Hope you enjoy playing around with them!</p>
